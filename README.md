## Using the Deployed Backend

If you prefer to use the already deployed version of the backend, follow these steps:

1. **Base URL**:  
ðŸ”— Use the deployed API base URL for all requests: => https://school-management-system-5qcl.onrender.com
2. **Authentication**:  
- Most endpoints require authentication. Ensure you obtain a valid JSON Web Token (JWT) by logging in via the `/users/login` endpoint.
- Include the token in the `Authorization` header for subsequent requests:
  ```json
  {
    "Authorization": "Bearer your_token_here"
  }
  ```

3. **Available Endpoints**:

4. **Testing the API**:  
- Use tools like **Postman**, **cURL**, or any API testing tool to interact with the backend.  
- For example, to fetch all blogs:  
  ```bash
  curl -X GET https://bloging-app-backend.onrender.com/
  ```

5. **Error Handling**:  
- If an error occurs, the response will include a status code and a descriptive message. For example:
  ```json
  {
    "error": "Unauthorized access"
  }
